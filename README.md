# Data Structures & Basic Algorithms

Re-writing existing data structure classes to practice and understand implementation of these Data Structures.

Write and implement basic sorting, searching algorithms.

Written in both Java and C using best practices to avoid memory leaks in both languages.

Implemented data structures: 
- Linked Lists
- Queue
- Dictionaries

Implemented Search and Sorting algorithms:
- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
